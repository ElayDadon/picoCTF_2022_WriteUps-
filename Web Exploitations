in the site we see the next message: 
Only letters and numbers allowed for username and password.
so I wondered what will happen if we just write !!!! in the username and password. 
then I looked at the source and I've seen the file: secure.js
in that page I saw the next function: 
function checkPassword(username, password)
{
  if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    return false;
  }
}
so I've put those values and got the flag back.

Here's the website.
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt 
but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?
first of all I looked at the source. 
<form role="form" action="read.php" method="post">
      <input type="text" name="filename" placeholder="Filename" required=""><br>
      <button type="submit" name="read">Read</button>
    </form>
we can see here the file read.php
when we write it in the page, we discover the next thing: 
$firstChar = $_POST['filename'][0];

if( strcmp($firstChar, '/') == 0 )
{
echo "Not Authorized";
}
else
{
if (file_exists($_POST['filename'])) {

$file = fopen($_POST['filename'], 'r');

while(! feof($file))
{
$line = fgets($file);
echo $line. "
";
}

fclose($file);
} else {
echo "File does not exist";
}
}
?>
which is a php code which tells us how they filter the absolute path. 
then we tried the next thing 
../../../ 
and we got nothing back 
so we tried pluging in flag.txt 
../../../flag.txt
and we didn't get it back, after some trial and error we got the next thing: 
../../../../../../../flag.txt, which worked and got us back teh flag.

Go to this website and see what you can discover.
web - http://saturn.picoctf.net:55287/
first, we look at the source of the web: 

function continueAsGuest()
{
  window.location.href = '/check.php';
  document.cookie = "isAdmin=0";
}

in the next function we see that for continuing as a guest, you need the isAdmin value to be 0. 
so we click on the button and get the next thing: 
We apologize, but we have no guest services at the moment.
we look inside the application, and we see the value isAdmin which set to zero
we can switch it inside the application tab in the value and then we get the flag.
